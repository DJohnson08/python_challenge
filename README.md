From the poll data, In the recent election, Diana DeGette decisively won with 73.8% of the total votes, totaling 272,892. Charles Casper Stockham received 23.0% with 85,213 votes, while Raymon Anthony Doane garnered just 3.1% with 11,606 votes. 
With a significant margin, DeGette's victory reflects a strong preference among voters, securing her position as the clear choice in this election. 
I believe this could be an accurate poll in today's society due to human nature of gravitating towards a certain candiate, depending on location.
