From the poll data, In the recent election, Diana DeGette decisively won with 73.8% of the total votes, totaling 272,892. Charles Casper Stockham received 23.0% with 85,213 votes, while Raymon Anthony Doane garnered just 3.1% with 11,606 votes. 
With a significant margin, DeGette's victory reflects a strong preference among voters, securing her position as the clear choice in this election. 
I believe this could be an accurate poll in today's society due to human nature of gravitating towards a certain candiate, depending on location. 

From the bank data, we can see the greatest flucuations are actually quite close in value showing equals trends in both directions, before running the code I was assuming the data would have a greater variety in spikes of value. 
While the average is negative thats never a good sign since if the bank loses money then the average household in that area does too. We are limited by the number of months pulled in the analysis as well as the full value of the banks in the surronding areas even countrys. 
I know thats a vague example but money is heavily dependant on where its at nationally. 

This exercise not only showed coding for the class, but real world data analysis that would need to be done to simplify all of this data, to then be presented to higher ups who make decisions that have massive impacts on individuals lives and money.
